        <p class="description">These dairy-free Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes are light, fluffy, <br>
            and seasoned with hefty dose of garlic, rosemary, and cracked black pepper. </p>
        
        <h2 class="ingredients-heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>2.5 lbs. russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt (for cooking water)</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable broth, warmed</li>
            <li>freshly cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>salt to taste (about 3/4 tsp)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="steps-heading">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>Peel and dice the potatoes into 1-inch cubes. <br>
                Place the potato cubes in a colander and rinse well with cool water <br> to remove the excess starch.</li>
            <li>Place the rinsed potatoes in a large pot, <br>
                fill it with enough water to cover the potatoes by one inch, then add 1/2 tsp salt.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a lid, place the pot over high heat, and bring it up to a boil. <br>
                Once boiling, remove the lid, and reduce the heat to medium. <br>
                Continue to boil the potatoes for about 10 minutes, <br>
                or until they are very soft (they should break apart when pierced with a fork).</li>
            <li>While the potatoes are boiling, prepare the garlic infused olive oil. <br>
                Mince the garlic and add it to a small sauce pot or skillet with the olive oil. <br>
                Heat the oil and garlic over medium-low heat. Let the garlic sizzle in the oil for 1-2 minutes,<br> 
                or just until the garlic is slightly softened, but not brown. <br>
                You just want to take the spicy raw bite off the garlic flavor. <br>
                Remove the sauce pot from the heat and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Drain the boiled potatoes in a colander and rinse again, briefly, with warm water. <br>
                Return the rinsed and drained potatoes to the pot, with the heat turned off. <br>
                Add garlic and oil, dried rosemary, some freshly cracked pepper <br>
                (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill), and about 1/2 cup warmed vegetable broth.</li>
            <li>Mash the potatoes or use a mixer to whip them until light and fluffy, <br>
                adding more vegetable broth as needed to keep them soft and moist <br>
                (I used about 3/4 cup total broth). Taste the mashed potatoes <br> and season to taste with salt and pepper. 
                Remember, adding an adequate amount of salt <br> will help the flavors pop. Serve warm.</li>
